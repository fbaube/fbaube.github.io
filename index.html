			<p><br/>This is the very minimalistic Github home of Fred Baube. </p>
			<p>I offer freelance &amp; consulting services in documentation and technical communications. </p>
			<p>My job is to make you and your company look good. If your organization needs clear, complete and accurate English language materials in complex topics like software, finance, and corporate communications, contact me. I am based in Helsinki. </p>
			<p> I bring to the table a combination of solid &amp; varied work in technical communications, many years in software development, experience in two startups, native English proficiency, excellent writing skills in general, and strong interests in structured modular documentation, documentation quality management, and public policy &amp; infrastructure.</p>
			<p> In a software firm, developer time is a scarce and valuable resource. I communicate effectively and productively with software developers to convert their knowledge into much more customer-friendly forms suitable for international audiences of non-native English speakers from diverse backgrounds. Similarly I can act as a "bridge" between technical and non-technical people to ensure that concepts and requirements are communicated and explained optimally.</p> 
			<p> I also do voiceovers and a bit of contemporary dance.</p>
