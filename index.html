        		<!-- h2>Greetings...</h2 -->
			<p><br/>This is the rather minimalistic Github home of Fred Baube. </p>
			<p>I offer freelance &amp; consulting services in documentation and technical communications. </p>
			<p>My job is to make you and your company look good. Contact me to discuss your needs if your organization wants clear, complete and accurate English language materials in complex topics like software, finance, and corporate communications. I am based in Helsinki. </p>
			<p> I bring to the table a combination of solid &amp; varied work in technical communications, many years in software development, experience in two Helsinki startups, native English proficiency, excellent writing and copyediting skills, and strong interests in structured modular documentation, documentation quality management, and public policy &amp; infrastructure.</p>
			<p> In a software firm, developer time is a scarce and valuable resource. I communicate effectively and productively with developers to convert their knowledge into customer-friendly forms suitable for diverse non-native English speakers in regional and international markets. Similarly I can act as a bridge between technical and non-technical people to ensure that concepts, requirements and designs are communicated optimally. Add to this productization experience and documentation process design. </p> 
			<p> I also do voiceovers and a bit of contemporary dance.</p>
